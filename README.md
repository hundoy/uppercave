a library to make swing easy

This is a personal project for myself. I like to use pure swing code when I create a java GUI, but it's too miscellaneous and difficult to remember.
So I simplify them and make them easy to write and remember. Hide the redundant code and make the UI logic more clever and easy to maintain.
This project is still in development.
